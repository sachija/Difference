<h1>5. Difference between useEffect and useContext ?</h1>
    <h4>useEffect-</h4>
      It allows us to implement all of the lifecycle hooks from within a single function API.
    1.componentdidMount- this will run when the component mounts,This will run, when the component is first initialized   <br><br>

  2.componeneDidUpdate-This will run only when count state changes and anytime the stateful data changes  <br> <br>
 3.componentWillUnmount-This will run when the component is destroyed or before the component is removed from UI. <br><br>
  
    <h4>useContext-</h4>
    <p>
      1.This hook allows us to work with React's Context API, which itself a mechanism to allow us to share data within it's component tree without passing through props. <br>2. Context API uses Context. Provider and Context. Consumer Components pass down the data but it is very cumbersome to write the long functional code to use this Context API. <br>
    
3.The useContext accepts the value provided by React.createContext and then re-render the component whenever its value changes but you can still optimize its performance by using memoization.
